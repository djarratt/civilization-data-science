# Civilization Data Science
This repo will contain data and scripts for analysis of Sid Meier's Civilization, especially Civilization V, such as machine learning and visualization approaches to the game's structure. Please visit https://civilization.com/ to purchase and enjoy one of the Civilization games! I have no legal rights or interest to anything surrounding Civilization, and its intellectual property and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

This repo is a work in progress. Civ V is a complex game and it will take me a while to structure its metadata in a manner appropriate for data science scripts to use.
