# Civilization Data Science
This repo contains data and scripts for analysis of Sid Meier's Civilization, such as machine learning and visualization approaches to understanding the game's structure. I first consider Civilization V including all expansions through Brave New World. Please visit https://civilization.com/ to purchase and enjoy one of the Civilization games! I have no legal rights or interest to anything surrounding Civilization, and its intellectual property and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

This repo is a work in progress. Civ V is a complex game and it will take me a while to structure its metadata in a manner appropriate for data science scripts to use.
